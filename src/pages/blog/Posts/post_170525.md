O7!

What to say?

Perhaps Some introductions are in order!

I'm Ascension, or Sasame Izuriha, or X19A, whichever you'd like to refer to me as!

I'm a Software developer by trade, and i'm currently studying for my Masters in Data Science!

I'm also a big gamer, and there are some of the current games i'm playing!

- Final Fantasy XIV
- Dota 2
- Granblue Fantasy
- SD Gundam G Eternal
- Wizardry Variants: Daphne

I'm currently based in Melbourne, Australia! I moved there recently, and it's been pretty sweet.

My current goals are to:
- Grow my Youtube Channel, check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/@Sasame_Izuriha)!
- Grow my Twitch Channel, which can be found [here](https://www.twitch.tv/sasameizuriha)!!!
- Work on some personal software projects! <br>
&emsp; - One would be this site itself! <br>
&emsp; - A project that would use AWS or Azure as a back-end
- Learn to draw! I never could and would love to learn
- Improve on learning the violin!

Should you have stumbled across this website, thank you for reading, and i'm looking forward to more!
